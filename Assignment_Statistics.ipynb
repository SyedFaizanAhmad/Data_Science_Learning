    "In the descriptive Statistics, the Data is described in a summarized way. The summarization is done from the sample of the population using different parameters like Mean or standard deviation. Descriptive Statistics are a way of using charts, graphs, and summary measures to organize, represent, and explain a set of Data. \n",

    "#Ans 3) The data is classified into majorly four categories:\n",
    "Nominal data\n",
    "Ordinal data\n",
    "Discrete data\n",
    "Continuous data\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative or Categorical Data\n",
    "Qualitative data, also known as the categorical data, describes the data that fits into the categories. Qualitative data are not numerical. The categorical information involves categorical variables that describe the features such as a person’s gender, home town etc. Categorical measures are defined in terms of natural language specifications, but not in terms of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes categorical data can hold numerical values (quantitative value), but those values do not have a mathematical sense. Examples of the categorical data are birthdate, favourite sport, school postcode. Here, the birthdate and school postcode hold the quantitative value, but it does not give numerical meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal Data\n",
    "Nominal data is one of the types of qualitative information which helps to label the variables without providing the numerical value. Nominal data is also called the nominal scale. It cannot be ordered and measured. But sometimes, the data can be qualitative and quantitative. Examples of nominal data are letters, symbols, words, gender etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nominal data are examined using the grouping method. In this method, the data are grouped into categories, and then the frequency or the percentage of the data can be calculated. These data are visually represented using the pie charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Data\n",
    "Ordinal data/variable is a type of data that follows a natural order. The significant feature of the nominal data is that the difference between the data values is not determined. This variable is mostly found in surveys, finance, economics, questionnaires, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordinal data is commonly represented using a bar chart. These data are investigated and interpreted through many visualisation tools. The information may be expressed using tables in which each row in the table shows the distinct category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative or Numerical Data\n",
    "Quantitative data is also known as numerical data which represents the numerical value (i.e., how much, how often, how many). Numerical data gives information about the quantities of a specific thing. Some examples of numerical data are height, length, size, weight, and so on. The quantitative data can be classified into two different types based on the data sets. The two different classifications of numerical data are discrete data and continuous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete Data\n",
    "Discrete data can take only discrete values. Discrete information contains only a finite number of possible values. Those values cannot be subdivided meaningfully. Here, things can be counted in whole numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Number of students in the class\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Data\n",
    "Continuous data is data that can be calculated. It has an infinite number of probable values that can be selected within a given specific range.\n",

    "#Ans 5) There are 4 levels of measurement:\n",

    "Interval: the data can be categorized, ranked, and evenly spaced\n",
    "Ratio: the data can be categorized, ranked, evenly spaced, and has a natural zero.\n",
    "Depending on the level of measurement of the variable, what you can do to analyze your data may be limited. \n",
    "There is a hierarchy in the complexity and precision of the level of measurement, from low (nominal) to high (ratio).\n",

    "The same is true for test scores and personality inventories. A zero on a test is arbitrary; it does not mean that the test-taker has an absolute lack of the trait being measured.\n",

    "Personality inventories\n",
    "Temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio Level:\n",
    "You can categorize, rank, and infer equal intervals between neighboring data points, and there is a true zero point.\n",
