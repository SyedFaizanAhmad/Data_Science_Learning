    "Ans 1) MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that we want with the querying and indexing that we need.\n",
    "      MongoDB’s document model is simple for developers to learn and use, while still providing all the capabilities needed to meet the most complex requirements at any scale.\n",
    "      Non-relational databases are sometimes referred to as “NoSQL,” which stands for Not Only SQL. The main difference between these is how they store their information.\n",
    "      A non-relational database stores data in a non-tabular form, and tends to be more flexible than the traditional, SQL-based, relational database structures. \n",
    "     It does not follow the relational model provided by traditional relational database management systems.\n",
    "      MongoDB is preferred over sql database in scenarios where we want to store unstructured data.\n",
    "      As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents. \n",
    "      This format directly maps to native objects in most modern programming languages, making it a natural choice for developers, as they don’t need to think about normalizing data. \n",
    "      MongoDB can also handle high volume and can scale both vertically or horizontally to accommodate large data loads."

    "Ans 2 ) The top most important features of MongoDB are :\n",
    "     a) Document Model\n",
    "        MongoDB has been designed with developer productivity and flexibility in mind. It is a document-oriented database, which means that data is stored as documents, and documents are grouped in collections. \n",
    "        The document model is a lot more natural for developers to work with because documents are self-contained and can be treated as objects. This means that developers can focus on the data they \n",
    "        need to store and process, rather than worrying about how to split the data across different rigid tables.\n",
    "        Documents are grouped together in collections. However, the documents in a single collection don't necessarily need to have exactly the same set of fields. This is what we call a “flexible schema.”\n",
    "        This flexibility allows developers to iterate faster and migrate data between different schemas without any downtime.\n",
    "     b) Sharding\n",
    "        Sharding is the process of splitting larger datasets across multiple distributed instances, or “shards.” When applied to particularly large datasets, sharding helps the database distribute and better execute what might \n",
    "        otherwise be problematic and cumbersome queries. Without sharding, scaling a growing web application with millions of daily users is nearly impossible.\n",
    "        Sharding in MongoDB allows for much greater horizontal scalability. Horizontal scaling means that each shard in every cluster houses a portion of the dataset in question, essentially functioning as a separate database.\n",
    "        Combining the data of the distributed shards forms a single, comprehensive database much better suited to handling the needs of a popular, growing application with zero downtime.\n",
    "     c) Replication\n",
    "        When your data only resides in a single server, it is exposed to multiple potential points of failure, such as a server crash, service interruptions, or even good old hardware failure. \n",
    "        Any of these events would make accessing your data nearly impossible. Replication allows you to sidestep these vulnerabilities by deploying multiple servers for disaster recovery and backup. \n",
    "        Horizontal scaling across multiple servers greatly increases data availability, reliability, and fault tolerance. Potentially, replication can help spread the read load to the secondary members \n",
    "        of the replica set with the use of read preference.In MongoDB, replica sets are employed for this purpose. A primary server or node accepts all write operations and applies those same \n",
    "        operations across secondary servers, replicating the data. If the primary server should ever experience a critical failure, any one of the secondary servers can be elected to become the new \n",
    "        primary node. And if the former primary node comes back online, it does so as a secondary server for the new primary node.\n",
    "        MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB’s DBaaS (Database-as-a-Service) platform, has a minimum of three member replica sets. They can span across multiple regions or even multiple cloud providers of your choice.\n",
    "     d) Authentication\n",
    "        Authentication is a critical security feature in MongoDB. Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the database. Without authentication, anyone can access your data.\n",
    "        MongoDB provides a number of authentication mechanisms for users to access the database. The most common is the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which is the default.\n",
    "        When used, SCRAM requires the user to provide an authentication database, username, and password.\n",
    "     e) Database Triggers\n",
    "        Database triggers in MongoDB Atlas are a powerful feature that allow you to execute code when certain events occur in your database. For example, you can use triggers to execute a script when \n",
    "        a document is inserted, updated, or deleted. Triggers can also be scheduled to execute at specific times.\n",
    "        MongoDB Atlas allows you to create and manage triggers in a simple, intuitive way. You can control your triggers through the Atlas UI.\n",
    "     f) Time Series Data\n",
    "        Time series data is most commonly generated by a device, such as a sensor, that records data over time. The data is stored in a collection of documents, each of which contains a timestamp and \n",
    "        a value. MongoDB provides a number of features to help you manage time series data.\n",
    "        The native time series collections in MongoDB are designed to be storage-efficient and perform well with sequences of measurements\n",
    "     g) Indexing\n",
    "        In our experience, the number one issue that many technical support teams fail to address with their users is indexing. Done right, indexes are intended to improve search speed and performance. \n",
    "        A failure to properly define appropriate indexes can and usually will lead to a myriad of accessibility issues, such as problems with query execution and load balancing.\n",
    "        Without the right indexes, a database is forced to scan documents one by one to identify the ones that match the query statement. But if an appropriate index exists for each query, user requests \n",
    "        can be optimally executed by the server. MongoDB offers a broad range of indexes and features with language-specific sort orders that support complex access patterns to datasets.\n",
    "     h) Load Balancing\n",
    "        At the end of the day, optimal load balancing remains one of the holy grails of large-scale database management for growing enterprise applications. Properly distributing millions of client \n",
    "        requests to hundreds or thousands of servers can lead to a noticeable (and much appreciated) difference in performance.\n",
    "        Fortunately, via horizontal scaling features like replication and sharding, MongoDB supports large-scale load balancing. The platform can handle multiple concurrent read and write requests \n",
    "        for the same data with best-in-class concurrency control and locking protocols that ensure data consistency. There’s no need to add an external load balancer—MongoDB ensures that each and every \n",
    "        user has a consistent view and quality experience with the data they need to access."
